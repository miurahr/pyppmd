Introduction
------------

``pyppmd`` module provides classes and functions for compressing and decompressing text data,
using PPM(Prediction by partial matching) compression algorithm which has several variations of implementations.
PPMd is the implementation by Dmitry Shkarin.

The API is similar to Python's bz2/lzma/zlib module.

Some parts of th codes are derived from ``7-zip``, ``pyzstd`` and ``ppmd-cffi``.

Development status
------------------

A development status is considered as ``Beta``.
